# firestone-prestige-calc
This helps with the optimal time to prestige. It is based on the calculations in the wiki by Fasp3000 link: https://firestone-idle-rpg.fandom.com/wiki/Temple_of_Eternals
When you add bonuses you have under Prestigious Bonus, only add Prestigious, not Firestone Effect Bonuses.
More rows can be added but you should adjust the Prestigious Bonus formula.
Unfortunately this only works until e309 (not included).

The main value to look at is the coefficient of viability. 
If it grows - that means you should stay put and not prestige.
If you are close to an upgrade, even if it is going down - check how things are after you adjust farm stage and the new upgrade.
In case the coefficient is still lower than max - you should probably prestige.

Note that you should convert hours to numbers. For example:
1:30h = 1.5;
1:24h = 1.4;
1h and 6 minutes = 1.1 as 60 min = 1h and so 6 min = 0.1;
